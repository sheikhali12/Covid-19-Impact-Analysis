# Covid-19-Impact-Analysis-Using-Python
In this project, I studied the spread of covid-19 among the countries and its impact on the global economy and the outbreak of covid-19 resulted in the highest number of covid-19 cases and deaths in the united states. One major reason behind this is the stringency index of the United States. It is comparatively low according to the population. I also analyzed how the GDP per capita of every country was affected during the outbreak of covid-19.
